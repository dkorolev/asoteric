# Asoteric

Asoteric is a programming language designed to make writing natural language parsing rules straightforward, maintainable, and production-ready.

TL;DR If you need a strict rule-based parser that can process a broad set of natural language queries with close to 100% input acceptance precision, Asoteric is what you need.

## Intro 101

In a nutshell, Asoteric is a powerful and flexible, yet 100% rule-based NLP engine.

The rule-based approach is suboptimal:

* for probabilistic problems, such as sentiment analysis, and
* in high-recall / low precision cases, such as high-volume low-info texting with tons of typos.

This approach is superior in domains where the cost of mistake is high. Exampes include:

* understanding the trading vocabulary,
* facilitating legal or medical decisions,
* the "linguistic shell",
* inventory management,
* business-critical data querying,
* task tracking.
