## Engine 301

DIMA: `utterance`? `nonce`?

The main functionality of the Asoteric engine is to parse the input query and to convert it into an iterator over a possibly empty set of strongly typed meaning tree objects.

While the above covers the vast majority of usecases, it is important to note that the engine also supports:

1. The spelling correction engine, and
2. Query debugging, a.k.a. the Asoteric Developer Tools,
3. Typeahead suggestions, customizable, and tailored to the rules set,
4. A regression- and A|B-testing framework to make team development with Asoteric easy.

- "Control", on-prem deployments based on pre-paid arrangements.
